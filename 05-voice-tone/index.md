# Jakub Kula - My Voice & Tone

---

## Voice

I design because that's what I like to do. On the other hand, it's still a business. Combining these two opposite parts into my voice makes it personal. On one side, there is formal, exact and businessy voice and on the other the cheerful and playful voice of my personality. Combining these two is not easy, but there are some (not so strict) rules to follow:

1. Simplify everything (instead of using an acronym specific to graphic design, write it out)
2. Write with confidence (believe in what you're writing)
3. Sneak a joke in (aim for subtle but straightforward)
4. Use powerful words wisely (don't exaggerate everything, spare it for something that deserves it)
5. Swear only if it's appropriate (use profanity in a jokeful way, or as an exaggeration)

## Tone

My tone depends on the situation and the target audience. It's always a mix of professional/formal and friendly/relaxed. The outcoming ratio of these two depends on who will read the text. I always aim to address readers directly as if I was speaking to them. This makes the text feel more personal and relaxed.

- Casual: joyful, friendly, optimistic, relaxed
- Formal: respectful, factual, serious

## Style

Styling is equally important as voice & tone. There are endless options when it comes to styling text. Style is the difference between a simple block of text and a readable, semantic piece of work. Readability is my ultimate goal. The best readablitiy and clarity can be achieved with the appropriate styling.

- Capitalize Headings (Capitalize Every Word Longer Than 3 Characters)
- Line length awareness (aim for 50-60 characters per line)
- Heading distribution and semantics (distribute headings evenly and decisively)
- Paragraph length (writing short and always on point)
- Contractions (if it's shorter, use it)
- Typeface (avoid unreadable fonts, always choose clean and reliable)
- Align left. (No exceptions!)
- Don't use UPPERCASE unless necessary.
- Fonts size matters (don't go too big or too small)
- Divide into paragraphs.
