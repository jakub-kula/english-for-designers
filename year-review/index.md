# Review

1. What did you like most about this subject?
The overall mood of this course was outstanding. The always positive and encouraging atmosphere.

2. What did you like least about this subject?
That would have to be the length of the classes. I think 3 hours at a time is a bit too much. But I understand that that is out of your jurisdiction.

3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?
- To think about my writing. This also helped me in terms of slovak/czech writing.
- I took interest in some accesibility issues since I sometimes deal with UI/UX which is very close to the general idea of this course.
- Not to focus on my spelling/grammar that much.

4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?
Probably the very first assignment. It just stood out somehow.

5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?
I/you pushed me to speak more english. Also the improvement in my writing.

6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?
Nothing extremely specific. Hope that is okay.

7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?
I would probably try to add more interactive activities or in-class group work.

8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?
Probably my attendance. I also noticed a slight drop in my personal enthusiasm in the last term.

9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?
I really liked your approach to teaching so nothing major. The only thing I would change is few of the last assignments since they were a little repetitive.

10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?
Listen, write, rewrite, optimize. Enjoy this course, Justin is an awesome teacher.
