# Wedos Logo Redesign
**Project background:** <br>
This design project started as a school assignment to redesign a logo of a company of my choice. I chose Wedos since I’ve had a good previous experience with their services. At first glance, their logo didn’t seem to fit into the overall visual identity. I couldn’t resist the urge to try and redesign the logo.
