# Wedos Logo Redesign

**Project background**
This design project started as a school assignment to redesign a logo of a company of my choice. I chose Wedos since I’ve had a good previous experience with their services. At first glance, their logo didn’t seem to fit into the overall visual identity. I couldn’t resist the urge to try and redesign the logo.

**Original vs. redesign**
The original logo is unfortunately a little old fashioned and does not comply with the current overall visual identity of Wedos. They've changed their webpage, ui, ux and visual presentation multiple times without a single change to the logo. My main focus during the redesign was to adapt the logo to the current visual identity.

**Deconstructing the logo**
Redesigning a logo like this comes with a few challenges. The main task when redesigning was to make sure that the new logo keeps all the fundamental meanings, ideas and the main message as close to the original as possible. The second challenge was to redesign the logo in a way that’s still recognizable and visually similar to the original, keeping the format, colors and the overall feeling look intact.
The specific meanings and the process of redesigning all the different elements of the symbol is explained in the image above.

**Main changes**
There were a few major changes to the logo consisting of 3 main parts. The first one was redesigning the symbol as explained in the previous picture. Secondly, there was a change in the logotype. The Wedos title has been replaced with a brand new logotype based on the Sofia Pro typeface and customized to fit into the general rounded style seen in the symbol. The last major change was the distribution of space and size of the logotype and symbol in relation to each other. The resulting logo is thereby clearer and easier to read with a balanced distribution of stroke weights.
