## About Me

Hi! I'm Jakub Kula and I see design as an important contribution to society. <br> I’m a designer mainly focused on advertising and logo design.

## My Story

I would describe myself as a designer with an unordinary attention to detail. <br> I aim to see things and think about things that are not visible at first glance.

For me, design is supposed to be beautiful, visually pleasing, easy to grasp <br> and while maintaining all these attributes, it still must fulfill its original purpose.

Throughout the years, I’ve gained most of my experience working on projects <br> that posed a challenge of some sort because problem solving and critical <br> thinking represent a significant part of the learning process when it comes to design.

In the outside world, I enjoy photography, going out into the wild, <br> exploring new places and spending time with people that matter.
