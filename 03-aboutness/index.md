## About Me

Hi! My name is Jakub and I see design as an important contribution to society. I’m a designer mainly focused on advertising in both print and online media.

## My Story

I would describe myself as a designer with an outstanding attention to detail. I aim to see and think about things that are not visible at first glance.

For me, design is supposed to be beautiful, visually pleasing, easy to grasp and while maintaining all these attributes, it still must fulfill its original purpose.

Throughout the years, I’ve gained most of my experience working on projects that posed a challenge of some sort – problem solving and critical thinking represent a significant part of the learning process when it comes to design.

In the outside world, I enjoy photography, going out into the wild, exploring new places and spending time with people that matter.
