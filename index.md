## 1st Semester Takeaways:
Here are a few things I learned this semester.
1. I was finally pushed to start using github in some way or another.
2. Content itself is more important than getting my spelling right.
3. I realized the importance of writing good, acessible and clear text.
4. Writing is hard. Even in my native language.
