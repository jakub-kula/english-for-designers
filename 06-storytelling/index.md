For those of you that don't already know who I am and what I do. Hi! My name is Jakub and I'm a graphic design student. Alongside my studies, I currently work part time in an advertising agency. Trying my best to gain some field experience.
Today, I'd like to guide you through the journey that finally led to this exact moment.
It all started about 21 years before. I was born in Slovakia, blah, blah, blah and so on. Fast forward to being an average 6-ish year old kid. People around me and I stared to notice that I'm interested in some really specific stuff. Instead of playing with my toys I often chose drawing. Nothing unusual so far, right? Well, the thing is I was not drawing things that you would expect from a kid this age. The specialty of mine was drawing places from memory. My grandma reminded me just last week, that I was able to draw entire floor plans and bird's eye perspectives of entire places. All of that just from memory. And we're talking my pre-school years. I remember these times very vaguely, but it blows my mind to this day. I often wonder where it took the turn and I ended up having an average imagination like today.
Moving forward to my pre-teen years. I gained access to an old computer. And boy was that a mistake. Or was it? I don't know. I spent hours in software like MS paint, drawing and playing with colors, shapes and so on. The only reason I'm mentioning all of this is that I think it highly influenced my development and eventually, helped me end up here.
Moving forward to my teens, I started lurking around other software and I finally pirated photoshop. As the time passed, I gained an opportunity to make some designs for a friend in Prague. We "met" through the internet and are still friends to this date. Let me just say the results were horrible. But they were good enough for us for the time being. Unfortunately, I don't have these designs to show you and deleting them a few years back is a thing I highly regret.
Moving on, I somehow ended up in a high school with a specialization of multimedia design. They taught us nothing about the industry, I didn't like most of the subjects and hated the way they taught us. But fortunately, that didn't change anything about my passion for design. And as a whole part of my life, it was pretty good, and I enjoyed it. It was in these 4 years when I realized what I want to try and perfect. 
So, I ended up signing up for the university of creative communication in Prague. Remember the guy from Prague that I started working with a few years ago? Yeah, he was one of the reasons why I ended up in Prague since I visited multiple times to meet up with our team. They all were saying that I'll end up in Prague someday. And boom, here we are, sitting right here with my bachelor theses right around the corner.
I'm not going to be boring you with my personal life because that's what the previous part was all about. Let's jump right to my professional life and the work I do.
Nowadays, I mainly focus on advertising and managing company visual identities. I sometimes design a logo here and there. Consult a website, make some UI and UX changes on existing projects... O, and yeah! I like to take photos. Architecture, night photography, landscapes, digital, analog you name it...
Unlike others, I'm not the art type of guy. I jumped straight into the corporate scheme of making designs that work. So, the conclusion is, that I didn't find my personal style yet.
I started working for a small advertising agency about one and a half years ago. The company is called Notigo and it's basically just a group of young students trying to learn everything about the world of advertising. Sometimes it's a hit or miss. We mostly learn through mistakes and that's also something I want you to take away from this presentation.
When designing, I mainly focus on clarity, simplicity and the correct delivery of the required goal. This especially applies when designing with the aim of selling something. I always try to deliver the message in the simplest form possible while respecting the client's requests. I think that the balance between what you want to do and what the client has in mind is the most important thing when it comes to design. At least in the designs that I do most.
The conclusion is to always be yourself. Try to find what fits you the best and never stop exploring opportunities around you. You never know where you might end up.
Bringing this presentation to an end I'd like to show you some of my work to make a picture about me and my work.
Thanks for your attention and feel free to ask me anything.
