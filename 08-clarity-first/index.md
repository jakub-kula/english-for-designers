## Key Points

<!-- Key points; aim for **30–60 words** each. -->
1. Background/importance of the topic:<br> I chose this topic because, when it comes to design, I have an inclination towards visual identities. Also, designing a visual identity provides for a wide range of creative opportunities. Choice of the subject was a simple process since I have been a volunteer of Vydra since 2015.

2. Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of the problem):<br> The main purpose of my thesis is to create a design that works. The current visual identity of Vydra is almost non-existent. I am personally interested in the wellbeing or the organization, thus I aim to help both the community and Vydra itself.

3. Research — design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations:<br> Theoretical part of my thesis will be backed up by a careful choice of books in the field of graphic design. One of the goals it to compare and analyze similar competitors which I will achieve with a thorough research.

4. Findings (highlight outcome of research):<br> N/A

5. Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society):<br> As a result, I am hoping to create a unique visual identity that will proudly represent Vydra. The main real life inpact of my work will hopefully be a notable rise in brand visibility and an increase of public interest.
