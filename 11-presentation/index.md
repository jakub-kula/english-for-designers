## Insight into my work
**Topic choice:**<br>
I chose this topic because, when it comes to design, I have an inclination towards visual identities. Also, designing a visual identity provides for a wide range of creative opportunities. Choice of the subject was a simple process since I have been a volunteer of Vydra since 2015.

**Main goal:**<br>
The aim of my work was to create a functional and effective visual identity that meets the ideology and specific requirements of the organization and to describe the process that preceded the creation itself. I was hoping to create a unique visual identity that will proudly represent Vydra. The main real life inpact of my work will hopefully be a notable rise in brand visibility and an increase of public interest.

**Motivation:**<br>
The previous visual identity of Vydra was almost non-existent. I am personally interested in the wellbeing or the organization, thus I aimed to help both the community and Vydra itself.
